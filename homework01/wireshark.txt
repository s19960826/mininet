There are many different type of messages displayed in Wireshark.

For example:

1. of_hello
- Because this message only appear a few times when we start the Mininet. We guess this is the message like TCP handshake or the connection setup between the controller and switch.

2. of_features_request
- We guess this message appear when the controller want to get the configuration or information of switch. ex: the port setting

3. of features_reply
- Switch send its configuration and the port setting back to the controller.

4. of_set_config
- We guess the message appears when the controller want to change the switch's configuration. ex: change the port setting or change the content of flow table.

5. of_flow_delete + of_berrier_request
- The controller want the switch to delete some flows from the flow table. The controller also want the switch to queue all incoming messages and process prior messages.

For this message type, we make reference from the webpage:

6. of barrier_reply
- The switch reply to the controller after it complete processing prior messages.

7. of_echo_request 
- The controller wants to make sure that the connection with the switch still works.

8. of_echo_reply
- The switch reply to the of_echo_request massage.
